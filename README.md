# Python Cohort 1
# 🚀 Python for Blockchain - Cohort 1

Welcome to my first blockchain project using Python! This repository documents my learning journey, experiments, and code samples as I explore the fundamentals of blockchain technology.

## 📌 What I'm Learning

- Basics of Python programming
- How blockchains work (blocks, chains, hashes)
- Creating a simple blockchain from scratch
- Data structures (lists, dictionaries)
- Proof of Work and consensus algorithms
- Introduction to decentralised applications

## 🧪 Projects in Progress

- ✅ Simple blockchain structure in Python
- 🔄 Hashing and block validation
- 🔐 Proof-of-work challenge
- 🌐 REST API for blockchain using Flask

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.10+
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub
- PowerShell (for terminal commands)

## 📈 My Goals

- Understand the core logic behind blockchains
- Build my own mini blockchain
- Push projects to GitHub with proper version control
- Eventually deploy a simple DApp

## 🙌 Thanks

Grateful to be part of this learning journey! Big thanks to instructors, mentors, and all who contributed to the course materials.
